# 🚨 **SafetyNet - Emergency Response System**

**Real-time emergency alerts & response system for faster rescue operations.**

## 📌 **Overview**
**SafetyNet** is a smart emergency response system that instantly connects users with critical services like **fire, medical, and police**. With just a tap, users can send SOS alerts, share real-time locations, and receive life-saving assistance when every second counts.

### **🔹 Why SafetyNet?**
✔ **Instant SOS Trigger** – Notify emergency services with a single tap.  
✔ **Real-time Location Sharing** – Send GPS coordinates or nearest cell tower data.  
✔ **High-Priority Alerts** – Loud alarms for responders until action is taken.  
✔ **Multi-Category Support** – Fire, accidents, medical emergencies, and more.  
✔ **Triple-Tap SOS** – Trigger emergency alerts even when the phone is locked.

## 🚀 **Features**
✅ **Emergency Alert System** – One-click SOS for instant assistance.  
✅ **Live Dashboard for Responders** – Displays emergency requests with details.  
✅ **Multi-Device Support** – Works on **mobile & web platforms**.  
✅ **Custom Emergency Calls** – Users can add personal emergency contacts.

1️⃣ **User sends an SOS alert** with location details.  
2️⃣ **Emergency departments receive high-priority alerts** with continuous notifications.  
3️⃣ **Location is shared in real-time** (GPS or nearest cell tower).  
4️⃣ **Responders take action** and acknowledge the request.  
5️⃣ **System logs all incidents** for analysis and future improvements.
